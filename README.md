# Attribution Modelling and Budget Optimization
Our goal is to go through a set of channels of marketing campaigns (Instagram, Paid Search, etc.) before a customer converts. How do we attribute to this conversion? Could it be because of Facebook, Instagram, or various channels contributing equally? 
## Rule-Based Engine: Single-Touch Attribution Models
These focus on giving a 100% carrier credit to only one touch point in a user journey, by which we mean a marketing campaign channel. A last-touch attribution model may give 100% credit to a customer's most recent touch point. A last non-direct touch attribution may look at traffic that was guided to your website from another source, like a link on a Twitter post, and observe the last touch point in this journey.
## Rule-Based Engine: Multi-Touch Attribution Models
There might be a lot of biases involved in single-touch attribution models: 100% credit for one channel won't usually make practical sense. These include **linear atribution models**, **position-based (U-shaped) models**, **position decay attribution models**, among others.
## Probabilistic Attribution Models
These are based on machine learning and probabilistic models, like shapley value-based models, or Markov chains.

(More context coming soon)

From these experiments, I aim to build a simple budget optimization engine.
